# Belly Button Biodiversity
Module 12: Plotly & Belly Button Biodiversity

## Purpose

To assist Roza with making a dashboard that is adaptive based upon each volunteer's ID number to visualize the bacterial composition of their belly button by species. This will provide information to support the company Improbable Beef in their quest to locate potential sources of necessary bacteria to manufacture synthetic beef.

## Dashboard Overview

Using the Volunteer Selection Panel select the ID number associated with the volunteer of interest, their demographic information is displayed below the selection:

A horizontal bar chart is then displayed with the top 10 most prevelant bacteria in descending order:

A gauge chart is also updated with the frequency of washing the belly button area:

Finally, a bubble chart is included to show the relative frequency of the bacteria contained in the volunteer's belly button:
